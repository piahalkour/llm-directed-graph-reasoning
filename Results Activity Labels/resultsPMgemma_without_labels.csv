At the start of this exercise I knew that at least all nodes directly connected to 15 should be added to the list. As a second step I went through each edge and removed the node that was reachable by direct or indirect path already. For this I created a set that contained the current nodes.

Process Graph;Connectivity;Reachable from nodes - Number;From how many nodes is node 15 reachable? ;Process;algo+fs+sc;8;-1;-1;False;" A DFS starts from a chosen node, where the chosen node is picked arbitrarily. A node is visited when the function visits the child of the node. We search for the target node. If the target node is found, then the node must be visited. Else we try to find the target node in another branch. "" } In the question below, there are tasks, you need to answer which tasks which can be done in parallel. The Tasks are numbered starting from 1. Dependencies are stored in a dictionary using the following key-pair: Task : [list of task dependencies] Task 2 : [1] Task3: [1] Task 4: [2,3] Task 5: [2,3] Task 6: [1] Task7: [2 ] Task 8 : [3] You might write a pretty code and use an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) complexity, but we'll assume you don't have enough memory. You can at most store a list of max. n. You're given a list of sizes a0, a1,..., an-1. A node is placed on the list at index i in time step i. A node is removed at which point you need to store the size of the list (i.e. the number of nodes containing the list). Create a function that can calculate the answer in the function called nb_node(). The function receives maximum number of node mb and the list, which contains sizes, like this [.0, 3, 2, 2, 4] and returns a list containing the number of nodes of the list. in every time step. .

Please add a logic in the method so that it returns a list of sub-matrices starting mat, which are exact matches to key, in exact order, and containing no duplicates. For example: the sub-matrices [[1,2],[3,.4]] j j [[2,4],[1,3]]. For example: a solution to the above task is possible in O(nm2^2 + m^3) by scanning the row of each matrix. You can achieve S.A. hint: in your cache, you need to store the [row, col] tuple as the key, and the value can be the match count. Do NOT make a global variable. import numpy as np def sub_matrix(mat, key): # Your code here return Answer : sub_matrix([ [[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[2, 4], [1, 3]] ([1, 2],[3, 4]]) # [1] The graph above represents a flow network from sources (represented by nodes 1...11) to sinks (represented by nodes 11...23).

Represent them in the following form: [s, a, t] Problem 4.10: 30-page binary search tree (25 points): In this rather basic problem, we want to design a simple binary index tree with the following important restriction: All internal nodes have 30 children and all leaves are traversed in the same order as the original sequence. There are important reasons behind this in the next problem! However, this design is easier to implement in a multidimensional setting You will have to read the documentation of the NumPy broadcasting rules since this problem relies on this concept. Problem 4.11: Multi-dimensional binary index tree (100 points): In this problem, we will design a multidimensional binary index tree that also satisfies the same constraints as in problem 4.10. However, we need a structure that is the following: 1- For each level L, the number of children for any node will be 2^L + 1 2- The overall structure of the tree will be uniform, such that given the sorted positions of the children in each leaf/non-leaf node, all non-leaf nodes at the same level will be the sorted union of their children - This is called ";Run a DFS or BFS from every node and count how many can reach the target node.

Use the breadth first tree search on $G$, where the <em>is-ready</em> test is the following: let $n_{v}$ be the level of the vertex $v$ in the graph, the vertex $v$ is ready if and only if the level $n_{v}$ is greater than any level label of any vertices in $F(v,V\[1em] $ <h3>3. The Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3> Finally, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the length of the shortest simple path from any given source vertex $s$$t$ by taking the following steps: For vertex $v\[1em]$edge{(s)}(v-s_{i},v-s_{i}][0]For every edge i-l :For every edge t-m,let m_i,m_{l} be the vertex values of i_l and i_{(l}$$l$ 1 = distance(true-startnode), l = 0, n; Let t be the <u>short</u>estsimple path from every startnode to any other node v's as shownbelow: 1234567891011121314151618192021222324252627 <h3></h3> Let s be the <u>short</u>estsimple path from startnode to all other nodes in 1234,56789101112131415161819202 A shortest simple path is a simple path with the smallest numberof vertices in the graph whose <u>cost</u> is a minimum sum of all weightededges on this path. In math terms, when we traverse in shortest simplepath from source to a target, we first add the edge weight of edge 001 <strong>Answer2.json</strong>: } <h2>Answer1.solution</h2> In this test, we are to calculate the weight of the shortest simple path between two vertices. If there are no edges between two vertices, we will calculate the minimum weight of the edges from one of those vertices and then find out the difference between this minimum weight and the sum of weights of all other edges. If there are edges between two vertices, we will simply do the same as above and find out the corresponding weight difference. If the vertices are of the same edge, we will count the number of edges and find out how many edges there are from both vertices to 3:945}{945},{10}{945},{10}{945}},{";Use BFS (unweighted graph) or Dijkstra's algorithm (weighted graph) to find the shortest path and return its length.

Question: What is a cycle? Your code is considered a solution if it prints all the cycles correctly. Note that if your graph has more than one cycle then you must print all the cycles. For example, if your graph contains 2 cycles, then you must print both of them. For example, graph with 2 cycles: 17 1 10 12 14 2 3 15 13 16 4 5 9 8 6 7 Your code is considered a solution if it prints the two following cycles: 13 15 14 12 10 17 1 4 2 3 10 13 15 14 12 10 13 15 14 12 16 1 5 6 8 9 12 17 1 4 2 3 15 13 12 10 1 8 5 6 9 12 17 1 4 2 9 12 17 1 4 2 - 17 1 4 2 -   The number of edges in the graph is 18. There are two cycles in the graph 13 15 14 12 10 17 1 4 2 3 10 13 15 14 12 10 13 15 14 12 16 1 5 6 8 9 12 17 1 4 2 3 15 13 12 10 1 8 5 6 9 12 17 1 4 2 9 12 17 1 4 2 . Cycles are followed by a hyphen and followed by the number of edges if they were followed by a hyphen. Then print the number of edges of the second cycle. Then print the second cycle. Your output should be: Two cycles, 12 and 14 cycles. The response field should contain one number which is the number of edges. The reasoning field should contain your reasoning in several lines as to how you solved the problem like the example below.
