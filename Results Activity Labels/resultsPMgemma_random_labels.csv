Use a cycle enumeration algorithm (e.g., Johnson's) to detect and count all simple cycles in the graph. Question: How many simple cycles contains the graph? Respond in JSON with two fields: answer (the final result) and reasoning (a brief explanation).
Process Graph;Topology;Number of Cycles - Number;How many simple cycles contains the graph? ;Process;algo+bag+role+sc;11;78;78;False;As a graph analysis expert, with a strong focus on complexity, I applied the FloydWarshall algorithm to locate a certain simple cycle within a given graph while minimizing the time complexity. Starting with a graph of 15 nodes and 25 edges, I first constructed a 5 dimensional array to represent the vertices. Next, I initialized the array with the input edges, and calculated the distance between all pairs of nodes. To identify all simple cycles within the graph, I updated the array to contain all nodes and their respective shortest distances. For each node, I identified the shortest distance to every other node. In doing so, I ensured each node in the array contained a length which represented the shortest path from that node to every other node Within the array. Once all distances were calculated, I employed a dynamic programming approach to construct a graph representing all possible paths between any two nodes within the matrix. Doing so allowed me to count all the possible paths between two nodes and to quickly identify which ones had the shortest distance. Subsequently, I tracked all the possible pairs of nodes within the graph with a distance between nodes of one (1) and reduced the input edges to this pair. By comparing the distance between the nodes in the pair to the length by which all other nodes were able to traverse between them, I was able to identify vertices that formed a simple cycle and count the number of such cycles. To find all of the cycles with length one (1), I used a Breadth-First Search algorithm to search through the vertices within the array. Each node in the array was then evaluated to determine if the distance between it and any other node within the array was equal to that node. Then, this distance was compared to the length of the shortest path between any other node in the array. Doing so allows me to easily identify pairs of nodes which represent a simple cycle within the graph. By then summing the lengths of all the cycles identified during each comparison, I was able to calculate the total number of such cycles in the input graph. The result of this calculation is the final answer in our JSON response. The reasoning is given due to the fact that using the FloydWarshall algorithm we are able to reduce complexity by finding all simple cycles in polynomial time. ;Use Johnson's algorithm to enumerate all simple cycles and count them.

Process Graph;Topology;Concurrency Check - Y-N;Are node O_Accepted and O_Created concurrent? ;Process;zcot+sc;No;Yes;Yes;False;In graph theory, two vertices are called concurrent if they are not visible from each other in the graph. This means there is no path connecting the two vertices, but this property holds in both directions. Nodes A and B are not concurrent if A is visible from B, or if B is visible from A, or if A and B are the same note. In directed weighted graphs, the asymmetry in the direction of edges leads to three cases: In order to have transitive concurrents, we must have antisymmetry, hence X and Y must be different.

Process Graph;Topology;Hamilton path existence - Y-N;Is there a Hamilton path in the graph? ;Process;algo;Yes;Yes;Yes;True;The process starts in A_Accepted. A_Cancelled contains O_Cancelled as a next node (edge) with a network duration of 60.919  so then the graph goes to O_Created with an edge. After that the only possible step from O_Created to take the graph forward is to go to A_Accepted with a network duration of 0.895. These two branches have covered all the nodes in the graph and there aren't any more. For example if we go back to A_Cancelled but go from there to W_Handle_leads and then from W_Handle_leads to A_Concept which ends in a loop that will never get to A_Cancelled again because it is a directed graph.;Use backtracking or dynamic programming (e.g., Held-Karp algorithm) to test for the existence of a path visiting each node exactly once.

Process Graph;Connectivity;Directly reachable from nodes - Number;From how many nodes is node A_Pending directly reachable? ;Process;zcot+bag+sc;1;0;0;False;From each node is O_Created directly reachable as a node needs to be created after O_Create. From each node is A_Create_Application where an application can just be created or sent to O_Create. From each node is A_Submitted as the submitted applications follow their path to the application is Accepted (and not to A_Cancelled) or W_Complete_application is Final. From each node is A_Cancelled, W_Validate_application, W_Call_after_offers, A_Accepted, as the path to A_Create_Application or A_Validating goes through A_Cancelled or W_Validate_application or W_Call_after_offers or A_Accepted ,and from these nodes A_Pending is reachable. If you are submitting an application which is not going to be valid, it has not been validated and thus is Pending. A_Submitted creates an application which needs to be Called After. The reason for no incoming edge from O_Sent_mail_and_onlineis that after an application is sent, the validation process starts which can takes a while for the user to validate and thus goes through A_Validating to A_Pending before arriving at A_Submitted. Thus A_Sent_mail_and_online does not lead directly to A_Pending. If an application is Complete, then it cannot be Pending as it has not been Called After. O_Returned arrives at O_Create_Offerwhichleads to W_Handle_leads. If an offer was not created, no application can be completed and thus if we are at O_Complete no application can be Called After but it can be Submitted to get it Sent Mail be validated which could lead to Pending.;Let's think step by step.

Question: From how many nodes is node A_Pending directly reachable? Respond in JSON with two fields: answer (the final result) and reasoning (a brief explanation).
Process Graph;Connectivity;Directly reachable from nodes - Number;From how many nodes is node A_Pending directly reachable? ;Process;fs+bag+zcot+sc;1;1;1;True;"There is one path from node ""W_Handle_leads"" to node ""A_Pending"". Its duration is 0.037. We need to optimize the edge list based on the duration of the paths. However, the path length is 1 and we find that we cannot shorten the path unless we delete the edge that would disconnect paths. Therefore, this path is optimal and we check that no path to A_Pending is shorter. Since the path length is 1 and we have only one path, the answer is 1. The optimal edge set is the empty set. It allows us to save 0.037/0.037=100.0 percent of the total duration of the graph. The reduced duration of the graph is 60.919. We can see that deleting this path does not break any cycle. As a result, there are cycles in the subgraph outside of the reduced graph. However, the reduced graph contains no cycles. This makes it easy for us to construct an acyclic subgraph, all cycles being outside of the reduced graph. This A_Pending, nodes are in this subgraph. W_Handle_leads, ";Let's think step by step.

One efficient approach would be to run a DFS from every node. You should be able to count how many reachable nodes can reach the target node from each node from where you ran the DFS. If you count the reachable nodes in this way for each source node, you obtain a 1-order analysis of the directed graph. The goal of this task is to come up with a 2-order analysis: For each node, count how many nodes are reachable in which nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in how many nodes are reachable in In the resulting vector, the i-th element is the number of nodes that are reachable by i nodes in the directed graph. That is, the i-th element is equal to how many nodes i steps away from the target node O_Create_Offer are also reachable from each source node. As you can see, the number of elements in the vector is limited by the distance from the source node to the target node, which is 6 steps. In the graph description, each edge is described with a source node followed by a target node and the duration to reach that next node from the previous. Since there is no limit on how many steps to follow the edges in the graph, the edges from O_Create_Offer to O_Create_Offer are allowed. An alternative to computing the distance to each step is to ignore the edges to the same source node in the list of source nodes to target nodes (instead of being 6, the distance to step will be 5). It's up to you to decide which option to take to achieve consistency. A simple implementation would look as follows: The vector would reach an answer of{";Run a DFS or BFS from every node and count how many can reach the target node.

The Cartesian coordinate system contains coordinates. A plane, for example, can be specified using three coordinates. Most computer graphics is two-dimensional, and most cartography is three-dimensional. The Cartesian coordinate system allows us to position objects and, when needed, overlay two physical measures on each other. A Cartesian coordinate system may have different coordinate systems for each dimension. A coordinate system that has the same number of dimensions for every dimension is called a homogeneous coordinate system. A two-dimensional homogeneous Cartesian coordinate system can be composed of two identical systems with different measurements or by using the Euclidean space-time metric. A three-dimensional homogeneous Cartesian coordinate system can be composed of three identical systems with different measurements or one system with two orthogonal projections and one with complex trigonometric values. (Reference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), how does a computer read a image that has been converted into a vector document? The coordinate is the relative position of a coordinate in the document, where each coordinate is defined relative to the previous coordinate. The coordinates of a two-dimensional array are defined relative to the first two elements of the coordinate, that is, the coordinate (x, y) that represents the point (u, v). The coordinate (x, y) is then determined relative to the coordinate(w, w, w) in a rectangle representing the Cartesian plane. The coordinate (x, y) is determined relative to the coordinate(w, w, w) in a rectangle representing the Cartesian plane. The coordinate(x, y) of the plane is determined relative to the intersection of the rectangle with the Cartesian axis of the Cartesian plane. A rectangle is a space of two dimensions in which each point in space can be defined by three coordinates: two coordinates for each dimension and a height value for the third dimension. We call this the coordinate space of the Cartesian plane. The coordinate system is represented by a Cartesian coordinate system(x, y). The coordinates of a two-dimensional array in the Cartesian coordinate system are defined as coordinates of an array's elements relative to the first two elements of the coordinate system. The three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system contains a Cartesian coordinate system and a Cartesian real system. The two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is defined by the intersection of the Cartesian axis(x, y) with the Cartesian plane(u, v). The coordinate (u, v) is determined by the intersection of the Cartesian axis with the Cartesian plane The shape of the object in Cartesian coordinate system can be described in three dimensions by its three vertices. A two-dimensional image can be described by the three vertices X, Y, Z and the third vertex (O, w) that represents the orientation of the image. (Reference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), and how can a computer produce an image that describes the orientation of an object (Reference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system)? The plane has a Cartesian plane with coordinates (u, y), where u and v are the coordinates of the plane. There are many ways in which we could view the orientation and motion of the plane, but the basic idea is that a plane should have the same orientation relative to any other plane. A coordinate system can be rotated around a fixed point and rotated to an orientation where the orientation direction has been changed relative to any other coordinate system, or relative to a new point, in the direction of the line extending from this point. We can see this in the Cartesian Coordinate Plane(reference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) (In this case, u represents the direction of the line from the base point (n, w, k) to the bottom of the plane) (reference:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system)/(Reference: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), how do we construct a system that defines an object in 3D? For example, consider a cube with a corner, the length of which will be three times the length of another cube, but the length of the second cube, in the first cube, will be equal to the third cube, and the length of the third cube, in the second cube, will be equal to the fourth cube, and so on. The cube, however, cannot be defined in a fixed coordinate system, but rather in an absolute coordinate system relative to the other cube. As such, it is possible to define an absolute coordinate system relative to each other cube. In the ideal case, we would like to define our coordinate system so that the system can be viewed as an absolute coordinate system. (See, for example, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) A coordinate system can be represented as an absolute coordinate space, or as an absolute plane, or both. A plane can reference https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate in the form of a circle. The circle as the absolute reference point is represented as a circle with this formula: C = (b, a, c) = (b, a, b, d) The circle is an absolute, arbitrary point. The line extending from the point to the surface is the origin of the coordinate system. (See, for example,https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) A coordinate system is an ideal plane, with an absolute coordinate system. In the plane, the coordinates of each element of a plane are equal to the coordinates of the adjacent (Reference: wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_Coordinate_System wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). The plane is represented as the set of points (u, y), with u and v being the coordinates of a point, the coordinates of the point and the height of a point. A three-dimensional plane can be represented as the intersection of a three-dimensional plane. The plane contains the Cartesian coordinate point. This point has the coordinates(x, y). The other three points are located in a plane with the coordinates(y, z). In the plane of the coordinate plane, the intersection of the Cartesian point and the other points is represented as a set of points. The Cartesian plane can reference the Cartesian coordinate in the form of a sphere, given that the sphere is a plane in the coordinate space. (Reference wii: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), how would you represent this coordinate system in two dimensions? The Cartesian coordinate can be represented in two dimensional coordinates as the intersection of a Cartesian plane and a set of Cartesian points(u, y), with w being the coordinates of the point. (See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_Coordinate_Space) Each point in the 2D plane contains two coordinates(u, y) and one dimension of the point, which may be represented as a sphere, a set of points, a single point, or a Cartesian coordinate plane. The point can have the coordinates of its neighboring points. The points in the Cartesian plane can be represented as an element of a 2D plane, or, alternatively, as a set of points, such as {u, v} and {v, w}, where u corresponds to the coordinates of the neighboring points. (See, https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_Coord(Reference:) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), how do we interpret an item as a 2D item? The three-dimensional cartesian coordinate system provides 2D spatial information, and it is defined by the intersection of the Cartesian axis(u, v)) with the Cartesian plane(u, v).(Reference: http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_Coordinate_System) This axis is the direction of the plane. (Reference of: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian Coordinate Plane) Here, the axes are defined by the intersection of the axis with the Cartesian point (u). For the plane in the 3D plane, we can define the axes of the plane as the intersection between the axis the plane and the Cartesian coordinate axis. The Cartesian axis can be defined as the Cartesian plane (u). (Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_Coordinate), how we represent the elements of a 3D plane?

The second path has a lower weight. We arrive at W_Hanlde_leads. From W_Hanlde_leads we take the transition to A_Cancelde (weight:0.016), a weight on average should be less. Next time we get to A_Create_Application, you need to continue from there to A_Submitted, but node A_Create_Application have two transitions, hence there is a second A_Create_Application node. We chose the first transition to O_Created, the path is going to become a loop but the weight on the transitions is lower. We continue to O_Accepted - weight 0.895, and as a result we get to target node O_Accepted. As you can see there is no other way to get to the target, there are no other options.;As a graph analysis expert, your task is to determine the shortest simple path between two nodes in a directed graph.

But my understanding is the path from O_Sent_mail_and_online to O_Accepted is O_Sent_mail_and_online,W_Handle_leads,A_Pending,A_Create_Application,O_Created,A_Submitted,O_Accepted. I was able to determine this via the following steps: (1) O_Sent_mail_and_online has edges O_Sent_mail_and_online,O_Created,A_Create_Application (2) A_Create_Application has edges A_Create_Application,A_Create_Application,A_Create_Application,A_Create_Application,W_Call_after_offers (3) W_Call_after_offers has edges W_Call_after_offers,A_Pending,A_Create_Application,O_Created (4) O_Created has edges O_Created,O_Accepted,O_Created (5) A_Accepted has edges A_Accepted,O_Created,A_Create_Application (6) W_Call_after_offers has edges W_Call_after_offers,A_Pending,O_Create_Offer,A_Validating (7) A_Validating has edges A_Validating,O_Create_Offer,W_Handle_leads,A_Concept,A_Create_Application,A_Validating,A_Create_Application (8) O_Create_Offer has edges O_Create_Offer,O_Create_Offer,O_Create_Offer (9) W_Handle_leads has edges W_Handle_leads,W_Handle_leads,O_Create_Offer,O_Returned (10) A_Complete has edges A_Complete,A_Create_Application,W_Handle_leads (11) W_Handle_leads has edges W_Handle_leads,W_Call_after_offers,O_Create_Offer (12) O_Created has edges O_Created,O_Cancelled,O_Created (13) A_Cancelled has edges A_Cancelled,O_Create_Offer,O_Sent_mail_and_online,W_Handle_leads,W_Call_after_offers,W_Validate_application,A_Accepted,A_Cancelled (14) O_Returned has edges O_Returned,A_Create_Application,O_Create_Offer (15) O_Cancel_Create_Application has edges O_Cancel_Create_Application,A_Accepted (16) W_Handle_leads has edges W_Handle_leads,A_Concept,W_Validate_application,A_Create_Application (17) The final step was to map the paths listed above.  The shortest path from O_Sent_mail_and_online to O_Accepted is O_Sent_mail_and_online,W_Complete_application,A_Submitted,O_Accepted.  The path progresses as follows: O_Sent_mail_and_online is followed by W_Complete_application, A_Submitted, O_Accepted, A_Pending.  Note: I used a shortest path algorithm to map the paths.  In general, a shortest path algorithm is used to determine an optimal shortest path between two or more points.  It could also be used to find the shortest path between multiple points if the problem is NP-complete.  In this problem, the optimal path is O_Sent_mail_and_online,W_Complete_application,A_Submitted,O_Accepted.;Let's think step by step. A directed graph contains the nodes: 1,2,3.

Submit your program as a Python source (or Stages link to source) and the answer will simply be sent back as a JSON. I made a simple graph program in C. It has three functions: add_vertex() : add a vertex(including color, also white) to queue insert_graph() : input a graph (vertex, vertice, weight) queue_top() : delete a queue and compute the longest simple path length. Here is part of graph made by my function: W--2--S--0--A W--5--P--3--A A--6---E W--5--R--1--Q [W, 87], [S, 26150], [A, 0], [E, 16], [F, 34], [G, 34], [H, 35], [R, 42663], [P, 1901], [U, 13497], [Q, 0], [N, 10052], [V, 10], [M, 10], [L, 10], [I, 7], [D, 26], [K, 36008], [C, 34], [J, 34], [B, 34], [O, 10046], [W, 12880], [X, 1], [Y, 4] Now I got problem in computer the longest simple path in this example: W 4 29 4 9 7 7 X 8 5 4 8 3 8 Y 7 2 I have added the three graph to a list: a=[[W,4,29], [W,4,9], [W,7,7], [X,8,5], [X,4,8], [Y,7,2]] My graph is a DAG, yes? So, the topological sort of my graph is W, X, Y. The queue should be W->X and X->Y, right? But after I compute, the longest simple path length from W to Y is 8... How do I keep adding the edge when I change the vertex? Now I am using this code to computer the longest path. It only compute the first two vertex. If I use topological sort. Then how do I calculate the longest simple path from (x1,x2) to (x3,x4) ... xn? def queue_top(): top=queue.pop() print(top) vlist = [j for (k,j) in graph[top]] print(vlist) a=[min((len(vlist), v))] for ii in range(len(vlist)): if(color[vlist[ii]]==0 or color[vlist[ii]]==1): while graph[top][ii]!=0: a[0].push(vlist[ii]) if graph[top][ii]>.lsp[vlist[ii]]: .lsp[vlist[ii]] = graph[top][ii] + min((a[0].length(), a[3])) a[1] = top if color[ii]!=0 and .lsp[top]>min: a[0].push(vlist[ii]) if graph[top][ii]>.lsp[vlist[ii]]: .lsp[vlist[ii]] = graph[top][ii] + min((a[0].length(), a[4])) a[2] = top if color[ii]!=img and .lsp[top]>min: a[0].push(vlist[ii]) if graph[top][ii]>.lsp[vlist[ii]]: a[0].push(vlist[ii]) .lsp[vlist[ii]] = graph[top][ii] + min((a[0].length(), a[5])) a[3] = top color[ii] = 2 return .lsp Sorry for my poor English... I don't know what I'm saying. Thanks！ If graph is directed acyclic graph you might want to find critical path for weighted graph. Critical path is the sequence of task activities that will take longest time to complete from start to finish. This is a simple example of critical path of my assignment. The question is can anyone help me devise an algorithm to solve this. Please help me. Sorry if question is not clear or unclear please comment, I will try to answer. Thanks..

You can load the datasets by entering this link into a new Python query: <b>datasets.pydataset.org/KGraph/processgraph.json.gz</b> <h2>The approach</h2> Our analysis leverages the KGraph library from KGraph, Inc. to construct the graph and a regression algorithm (that fits a linear regression model to predict the length of paths on the graph and from a given starting to end node). <h2>Start a free trial</h2> You can start a free trial with no credit card required. Go to: <b>kgraph.io/trial</b> and follow the steps in the <b>How to build your graph analysis expert</b> video. The process of how we solved this question involved building the process graph with the given nodes and edges as demonstrated in the Graph Processing With KGraph. Once we built the graph with the nodes and the edges, we used the <code>graph.walk.simple()</code> function which yields walks in the graph (or more accurately depth first walks in the graph). These are the steps involved in building the simple path. To determine which walk is the longest we build a dataset of these walks: From there, we built an artificial intelligence for the prediction of the probabilities of these walks (i.e. walk from node A_Concept to node O_Create). Each of these walks had a probability. Finally, we order these walks from highest probability to lowest to determine which walk was the longest and return it. Here's a link to this notebook: https://gist.github.com/tushar/852c77bd338754e6e8be <h2>Why use graph analysis in machine learning</h2> Our solution to the problem has several important components that are driving growth in this space: - Access to incredibly large datasets in machine learning - Greater processing power not just in CPU but parallel processing / GPU computing - Availability of specialized computing architecture - Availability of specialized datasets / frameworks / APIs / libraries <h2>KGraph is not GraphDB, Graph Engine or Graph DSP</h2> Let us break down the nuances of graph database - graph engine - graph DSP (i.e. tools in the graph application stack). <table></table> </table> </table> </table> <h2>KGraph is the programming language for graph data science</h2> What KGraph aims to do is provide a simple graph data language that anyone can code in (no prior domain knowledge required) and is domain extendable (i.e. a developer can add support for a variety of features from existing graph databases / graph engines that one can program with). KGraph offers a cross- platform database, graph application and graph language stack, which enables you to easily port your code to the cloud or edge or for other use cases: - Edge computing (e.g. IoT or mobile computing) - Limited memory devices such as mobile smart devices - Building an application (i.e. for graph data) such as Graph DSP, knowledge graph, graph visualization, etc <h2>KGraph is also graph AI</h2> After solving several graph problems using KGraph, we realized that graph data science was a niche (graph data science + AI).

The reasoning is as follows: longest simple path from O_Created to O_Cancelled is from O_Created to W_Handle_leads to A_Validating to O_Sent_mail_and_online to W_Complete_application to A_Submitted to O_Accepted to W_Handle_leads to A_Concept to A_Create_Application to A_Cancelled to O_Cancelled which adds up to 625.725 + 100241.493 + 15974.692 + 599.357 + 0.996 + 122.949 + 0.023 + 234.531 + 234539.582 + 158695.98 = 1878.428. Note that 'longest simple path' means a path which does not contain cycles. Simple paths are listed in the order from the node with minimum value to the node with maximum value. A cycle containing nodes and is listed as twice the middle value of , , and the earliest node of , , (i.e. as ). For this question, the above reason should not be included into the reasoning. The reasoning should contain a brief description of methods applied, algorithm, and an explanation of your reasoning. If you code is complex, subroutines can be written if you prefer. Do not embed your code or subroutines into the essay. They should be self contained in a separate document if necessary. See the ;Let's think step by step.

As the graph is a simple one we can use an approach to solve this using all possible paths between the nodes and removing duplicates. Initially, all paths are stored as a string. The string is then broken into lists of transitions. To remove the duplicates, we use a dictionary mapping of the transitions. The answer is the total amount of transitions from the transition list. The most important line in the logic for the solution is line 14. This is where the transition string is broken into a list of transition names. The most difficult part of this problem was ensuring the dictionary was the correct size to store transition entries. At first, I iterated through and removed the duplicated transitions from the lists of transitions. This was significantly computationally unfeasible for the larger transition lists. With the current code, the maximum length of a transition list is the largest number of transitions from an intermediate node from the source node to any other node. Therefore, creating an empty dictionary with the same number of keys would solve the problem of a dictionary not being large enough.;The directed process graph contains the nodes: A_Accepted, O_Cancelled, A_Cancelled, W_Validate_application, A_Complete, O_Returned, W_Handle_leads, A_Concept, A_Create_Application, O_Created, W_Call_after_offers, A_Pending, A_Submitted, O_Accepted, A_Validating, O_Sent_mail_and_online, O_Create_Offer, W_Complete_application.

Respond in JSON with two fields: answer (the final result) and reasoning (a brief explanation).
Process Graph;Metrics;Number of edges - Number;How many edges contains the graph? ;Process;fs+zcot;29;,;Normalizing not possible;False;the final result} The sample response does not have to have any formatting issues or be limited to the exact format. These are guidelines only. The reasoning must contain at least 1 JSON structure, but may contain more. The maximum number of nodes in the graph is 26, and the maximum edges is 20. No node must be connected to itself and no edge must point to itself. An explanation of the reasoning must be provided. JSON files are not allowed as direct input but are allowed in the pull_json instruction command. If the input contains a pull_json instruction and the instructions is not on the root of the JSON, then the argument must be defined as well (e.g. pull_json some_path). This command uses a JSON that is inside the input. If an input has more than 1 pull_json instruction, then all of them should be defined as well (e.g. pull_json some_path1, pull_json some_path2). Every argument can be repeated. You must give the response in the same number of edges as that of the input. If a cycle is within the input, then it must be detected and eliminated as a pair of edges. For example: 1->2->1 should be counted as 1 edge. If any of the arguments are undefined, and it isn't at the json level, then it should be notified in the reasoning, it should print ;Let's think step by step.
