# Evaluating the Applicability of Large Language Models for Directed Graph Reasoning Tasks
This repository contains the code, datasets, prompts, and results accompanying the master's thesis  
**“Evaluating the Applicability of Large Language Models for Directed Graph Reasoning Tasks”**  
by Pia Halkour (2025, RWTH Aachen).

## Goal 

This project investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform reasoning on **directed graphs** through **prompt-based querying**.  
It compares the performance of different prompting styles, graph encodings, graph types, reasoning tasks and the usage of activity labels and analyzes their ability to extract structural graph information.

## Setup & Requirements

1. Create a Python environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt.
2. Insert your Huggingface Token to the script you use.
